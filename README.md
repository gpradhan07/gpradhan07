### ðŸ‘¦About Me

Hello there! It gives me great pleasure to present myself as Gourav Kumar Pradhan, a software developer and student. My passions include coding and developing new solutions to make people's life simpler.

As a student, I am always studying and improving my expertise in the field of computer science. I like learning new programming languages, frameworks, and tools, as well as experimenting with various coding styles in order to produce better and more efficient software.


Aside from being a student, I also work as a software engineer for github. Working with github has been a wonderful experience, allowing me to engage with engineers from all around the world and contribute to open-source projects that have a meaningful influence on people's lives.

My areas of expertise include [programming languages (JAVA, C, Python), frameworks (React, Springboot,Nodejs,Django).WebTechnologies (HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,ReactJs),Databases (Sql,MongoDB,Firebase),Tools (Adobe Photoshop,Adobe Illustrator)]. I'm always eager for new challenges and chances to learn and improve as a developer, and I feel that my enthusiasm for the profession makes me a significant contribution to any team.

When I'm not coding, I like [hobbies (Internet Surfing, Gaming) or interests (reading and watching Indian Mythology)]. I feel that having a well-rounded life is crucial for a successful developer, and I always find time for the activities I like doing outside of work.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds and continuing to have a great influence on the world through software development!
